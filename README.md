# Liquidity Pool and DEX Proof of Concept

## Overview
This project consists of two main smart contracts (DEX and Liquidity Pool). The DEX contract serves a simple function to allow users to create their own liquidity pools. The Liquidity Pool contract allows users to add liquidity, remove liquidity, and swap one token for another. 

Run ```npx hardhat test``` for some basic functionality tests for the smart contracts.

***Note:***
This project was created and tested with HardHat. Go to ```poc``` folder to see the smart contracts of this project.
